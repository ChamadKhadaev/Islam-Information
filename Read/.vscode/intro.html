    I great you with the Islamic greeting “Assalamu Aleykum” which means Peace be upon you! <br> <br>
        Your here to READ as you chose at the beginning!
        «Read» is in fact the first word Revealed in the Quran to our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him). <br> <br>

            Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good instruction, and argue with them in a way that is best. 
            Indeed, your Lord is most knowing of who has strayed from His way, and He is most knowing of who is [rightly] guided.

    <h2 id="islam">ISLAM</h2> <!----------------------ABOUT WORD ISLAM----------------------------------->
    <p class="islam" style="font-size: 22px; word-spacing: 1px; letter-spacing: 1px;"> So the first point is about Islam. Let’s start with the meaning of the word Islam.
Islam word from arabic means “complete submission to the will of God”. Originating from the word “Salama” with one of the meaning “Peace”.
The religion Islam is: The Peace attained by Complete Submission to the will of God.
<a style="text-decoration:underline double rgba(37, 37, 241, 0.863);" href="./terminology.html" target="_blank">(Allah in arabic)</a> &leftarrow;more in Terminology <br> <br>
Islam is not the New Religion which is one of the Misconceptions about this faith. In fact Islam exists from the 1st prophet Adam (peace be upon him) until Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him). All of the Prophets sumbitted themselves to the will of God and followed the
instructions (revelations) from their time. All of them were in Islam. <br> <br>

<!---------------------------------PILLARS COMPOSED----------------------------------->
The religion Islam is composed of 5 Pillars which are the most to accept and follow being in Islam. <br> <br>
We will go throught 5 pillars shortly: <br> <br>

<!--------------------------------------------1ST PILLAR----------------------------------->

<strong>The 1st Pillar is : “Tawhid” – Unification, Oneness of Allah (God). </strong> Which is declared in the Shahadah (Testimony of faith) which is the following :
“I bear witness that there is no deity but God, and I bear witness that Muhammad is the messenger of God." <br>
 Tawhid – IS the first and only lesson taught in all the religions all the way from Adam, Noah, David, Solomon, Abraham, Moses, Jesus and the Last Muhammad peace and blessings be upon them all.
 <br> <br> <em> <strong> Note: </strong> All of religions were Monotheist, and taught the oneness of God but while the time run, scriptures were corrupted and through out the history prophets were sent to bring back the humans to worshiping one and only God. The Last of them is Muhammad (peace and blessing be upon him). </em>

    <br> <br>
The oneness of God is told in Quran :
    <a href="https://quran.com/112" target="_blank">Chapter 112 of the Quran, </a> titled Al-'Ikhlās(The Sincerity) reads: 
     <br><br>
     <span style="background-color: rgba(24, 248, 117, 0.384);outline: 2px outset rgba(28,110,164,0.52);outline-offset: 1px;">
     112:1 - Say: "He is Allah, [who is] One. <br>
     112:2 - Allah, the Eternal Refuge. <br>
     112:3 - He neither begets nor is born,<br>
     112:4 - Nor is there to Him any equivalent."
     </span>
     <br> <br>
    That is the True Description of God (Allah), and anyone who desclares something, someone being God, must respond and fit those lines.
    <a href="https://zakirnaik.com/Introduction-DrZakirNaik/" target="_blank">Dr. Zakir Naik</a> explains the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zr5yO04fRIE" target="_blank">"The Touchstone of Theology"</a> in a short video. <br> 
    We Muslims are ready to accept the God who fits those 4 lines definition.
<br> <br> <br>

<!--------------------------------------------2ND PILLAR----------------------------------->

 <strong>The 2nd Pillar is: The 5 Obligatory daily Salat (Prayers) performed at fixed time.</strong> <br> <br>
    We read in Quran <a href="https://quran.com/11" target="_blank"> Chapter Hud, verse 114 </a> <br> <br>
    <span style="background-color: rgba(229, 247, 148, 0.712);outline: 2px outset rgba(28,110,164,0.52);outline-offset: 1px;">    
    «And establish prayer at the two ends of the day and at the approach of the night. Indeed, good deeds do away with misdeeds. That is a reminder for those who remember».
    </span>
<br> <br>
    <a href="https://quran.com/2:238" target="_blank"> Chapter Baqarah, verse 238 </a> <br> <br>
    <span style="background-color: rgba(229, 247, 148, 0.712);outline: 2px outset rgba(28,110,164,0.52);outline-offset: 1px;">
    «Maintain with care the [obligatory] prayers and [in particular] the middle prayer and stand before Allah, devoutly obedient.»
    </span>
<br> <br> 
    The 5 Obligatory Prayers are: Fajr (dawn) prayer. Dhuhr ( after midday) prayer. Asr (afternoon) prayer. Maghrib (sunsent) prayer and Isha (nighttime) prayer.
    Prayers are performed facing the direction of Mecca, The sacred mosque «Masjid Al-Haram» which is build around the Kaaba. The most sacred site in Islam.
<br> 
    Beside Obligatory Prayers, surrerogatory prayers can be performed. The most beloved surrerogatory prayers being during the Night* time ( *Night is after the last 5th prayer until the Dawn prayer).
<br> <br> <br>

<!--------------------------------------------3RD PILLAR----------------------------------->

<strong>The 3rd Pillar is: The Zakat, Charity ( from arabic: «that which purifies»).</strong> <br><br>
We read in the Quran <a href="https://quran.com/2:43" target="_blank" > Chapter Baqarah, verse 43</a>: <br> <br>
<span style="background-color: rgba(148, 244, 247, 0.603);outline: 2px outset rgba(28,110,164,0.52);outline-offset: 1px;">
«And establish prayer and give zakah and bow with those who bow [in worship and obedience]»
</span>
<br><br>
<a href="https://quran.com/2:177" target="_blank"> Baqarah, verse 177 </a>: <br> <br>
<span style="background-color: rgba(148, 244, 247, 0.603);outline: 2px outset rgba(28,110,164,0.52);outline-offset: 1px;">
«Righteousness is not that you turn your faces toward the east or the west, but [true] righteousness is [in] one who believes in Allah , the Last Day, the angels, the Book, and the prophets and gives wealth, in spite of love for it, to relatives, orphans, the needy, the traveler, those who ask [for help], and for freeing slaves; [and who] establishes prayer and gives zakah; [those who] fulfill their promise when they promise; and [those who] are patient in poverty and hardship and during battle. Those are the ones who have been true, and it is those who are the righteous.» <br><br>
Zakat is giving the fixed amount of one’s wealth once a year – to the charity used for the poor, needy, orphans, those in debt, the travellers, in the cause of Allah.
</span>
<br> <br> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakat" target="_blank"> Wiki art: </a> <br> <br> « The amount of zakat to be paid by an individual depends on the amount of money and the type of assets the individual possesses. The Quran does not provide specific guidelines on which types of wealth are taxable under the zakat, nor does it specify percentages to be given. But the customary practice is that the amount of zakat paid on capital assets (e.g. money) is 2.5% (1⁄40). Zakat is additionally payable on agricultural goods, precious metals, minerals, and livestock at a rate varying between 2.5% and 20% (1/5), depending on the type of goods.» 
<br><br><br>

<!--------------------------------------------4TH PILLAR----------------------------------->

<strong>The 4th Pillar is: The Fasting during the month of Ramadan.</strong> <br><br>
We read in Quran <a href="https://quran.com/2:183" target="_blank"> Chapter Baqarah, verse 183:</a><br> <br>
<span style="background-color: rgba(250, 177, 222, 0.623);outline: 2px outset rgba(28,110,164,0.52);outline-offset: 1px;">
«O ye who believe! Fasting is prescribed to you as it was prescribed to those before you, that ye may (learn) self-restraint.»
</span>
 <br><br>
<a href="https://quran.com/2:184" target="_blank">Chapter Baqarah, verse 184:</a> <br> <br>
<span style="background-color: rgba(250, 177, 222, 0.623);outline: 2px outset rgba(28,110,164,0.52);outline-offset: 1px;">
« (Fasting) for a fixed number of days; but if any of you is ill, or on a journey, the prescribed number (Should be made up) from days later. For those who can do it (With hardship), is a ransom, the feeding of one that is indigent. But he that will give more, of his own free will,- it is better for him. And it is better for you that ye fast, if ye only knew.»
</span>
<br><br>
1st day of Fasting starts with the month of Ramadan. Fasting is during the day from Dawn prayer time until Sunset prayer time.
During the fast, one should refrain from food and drink. During the month Muslims are also expected to put more effort into following the teachings of Islam by refraining from violence, anger, envy, greed, lust, angry/sarcastic retorts, gossip, and are meant to try to get along with each other better than normal. 
<br><br>
The Eid-Al-Fitr (Feast of breaking the fast) marks the end of the Ramadan month. 
<br><br>
<strong> <em> Note: </strong> Fasting is not to be considered only refraining one self from Food and Drink, but it’s a month of self-change, perfection in all the good deeds, Strive hard being a better person in all of the aspects. The month of Fasting also teaches us to keep those good qualities the whole year. 
As for the Prayers, Fasting can be done voluntary on the Mondays and Thursdays of the week, as used to do our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him)
</em>
<br><br>
<!--------------------NARRATION ABOUT DAVID------------------------------------->
And in one narration from our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessing be upon him) he said: <br> <br>
<span style="background-color: rgba(197, 247, 165, 0.712);outline: 2px outset rgba(28,110,164,0.52);outline-offset: 1px;">
« The most beloved fasting to Allah was the fasting of the prophet David who used to fast on alternate days. And the most beloved prayer to Allah was the prayer of David who used to sleep for the first half of the night and pray for the 1/3 of it and sleep for a sixth of it.»</span>
 <br> <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3420" style="float: right; display: block; margin-top: 3px;" target="_blank">Ref:Sahih al-Bukhari 3420</a>
<br> <br>  <br>

<!--------------------------------------------5TH PILLAR-------------------------------------------->

<strong> 5th Pillar in Islam is: The Hajj, The pilgrimage to the Mecca, Kaaba.</strong> <br> <br>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj" target="_blank"> Wiki art: </a> <br> <br>
«Hajj is a mandatory religious duty for Muslims that must be carried out at least once in their lifetime by all adult Muslims who are physically and financially capable of undertaking the journey, and of supporting their family during their absence from home.»
<br> «The Hajj is a demonstration of the solidarity of the Muslim people, and their submission to God (Allah).The word Hajj means "to attend a journey", which connotes both the outward act of a journey and the inward act of intentions.»
<br> «The Hajj is associated with the life of the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) from the 7th century AD, but the ritual of pilgrimage to Mecca is considered by Muslims to stretch back thousands of years to the time of Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him).»
<br> <br> <hr>
