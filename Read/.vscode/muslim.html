    <!---MUSLIM EXPLANATION--------->


        <div class="content">
            <h2 class="muslim">MUSLIM</h2>
        <p> <!---P-->
            So, the 2nd point is about Muslims. <br>
            First of all we must know, who is called a "Muslim"? <br>
            <!-------WHO ARE MUSLIMS----------PROPHETS WERE MUSLIM -------------->
            Muslims are those who follow and accept Islam. Ok, so muslims are new group of people following new religion Islam..? <br>
      <br>  Nope, if you have read carefully, "Islam" means "Submission to the will of God". So, those who submits completely to the will of one and only God, are called Muslims!
            So it's the the other way around. Those who accepted Islam ( submission to the will of God) are called Muslims (one who submitted). <br>
      <br>  Earlier we saw that all of the Prophets: Adam, David, Solomon, Jacob, Joseph, Abraham, Moses, Jesus and the last Muhammad peace and blessings be upon them all, submitted themselves completely to the will of one and only God,(practised Islam) so by definition they were Muslims! (submitted ones) <br>
            In Islam indeed we believe that all of the Prophets were Muslims and we make no distinction between them. <br> <br>

            In Quran we read : <a href="https://quran.com/2:285" target="_blank"> Chapter Baqarah (Cow), verse 285 (2:285) : </a> <br><br>
            <em> <span class="quran"> "The Prophet (Muhammad) believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in God, His Angels, His Books, and His prophets. (They say,) 'We make no distinction between one another of His prophets..." </span> </em>
            <br> <br>

            <a href="https://quran.com/35/24-25" target="_blank">Chapter Fatir (Creator), verses 24-25 (35:24-25) : </a> <br> <br>
            <em> <span class="quran">
            35:24 "Indeed, We have sent you with the truth as a bringer of good tidings and a warner. And there was no nation but that there had passed within it a warner." <br>
            35:25 "And if they deny you - then already have those before them denied. Their messengers came to them with clear proofs and written ordinances and with the enlightening Scripture."</span> </em> 
            <br> <br>

            <a href="https://quran.com/3/67-68" target="_blank">Chapter Ali Imran (Family of Imran), verses 67-68 (3:67-68) : </a> <br> <br>
            <em> <span class="quran">
            3:67 "Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was one inclining toward truth, a Muslim [submitting to Allah].
            And he was not of the polytheists." <br>
            3:68 "Indeed, the most worthy of Abraham among the people are those who followed him [in submission to Allah] and this prophet [i.e., Muḥammad (ﷺ)] and those who believe [in his message]. And Allah is the Ally of the believers."
            </span> </em> <br> <br>

            <a href="https://quran.com/6/83-90" target="_blank">Chapter Al An'am (The Cattle), verses 83-90 (6:83-90): </a> <br> <br>
            <em>
             <span class="quran">
6:83 "And that was Our [conclusive] argument which We gave Abraham against his people. We raise by degrees whom We will. Indeed, your Lord is Wise and Knowing." <br> <br>
6:84 "And We gave to him [i.e., Abraham] Isaac and Jacob - all [of them] We guided. And Noah, We guided before; and among his descendants, David and Solomon and Job and Joseph and Moses and Aaron. Thus do We reward the doers of good." <br> <br>
6:85 "And Zechariah and John and Jesus and Elias - and all were of the righteous." <br> <br>
6:86 "And Ishmael and Elisha and Jonah and Lot - and all [of them] We preferred over the worlds." <br> <br>
6:87 "And [some] among their fathers and their descendants and their brothers - and We chose them and We guided them to a straight path."<br><br>
6:88 "That is the guidance of Allah by which He guides whomever He wills of His servants. But if they had associated others with Allah, then worthless for them would be whatever they were doing." <br><br>
6:89 "Those are the ones to whom We gave the Scripture and authority and prophethood. But if they [i.e., the disbelievers] deny it, then We have entrusted it to a people who are not therein disbelievers."<br><br>
6:90 "Those are the ones whom Allah has guided, so from their guidance take an example. Say, "I ask of you for it [i.e., this message] no payment. It is not but a reminder for the worlds."
</span>  </em> <br> <br> 
        And in many other verses in Quran, it's mentioned about Prophets submitting themselves completely to the one and only God (Allah).
            <br> <br> </p> <hr>
          <!---------HOW PROPHETS FOLLOWED ISLAM-----------5 PILLARS------------>  
 <!--P-->       <p> How did the Prophets followed Islam (submission to one God)? How were they Muslims? <br> <br>

         We saw in the first point about <a href="./intro.html" target="_blank">"Islam"</a>, that 5 pillars stand for Obligatory acts in order to be in Islam (Submission to the will of God) and to be called a Muslim (Submitted or Submitter). <br>
         The Most IMPORTANT, which is the Key to enter the Islam is proclaiming the "Tawhid" (Unification, Oneness of God) in all the forms of *Worshiping. <em>*(We will see about all the forms later in details) </em> 
        <br> <br> 
         <!------PROPHETS CALLED TO TAWHID IN QURAN------------------->
        All Prophets called to Tawhid : Quran <a href="https://quran.com/21:25" target="_blank">Chapter Al Anbiya (The Prophets) verse 25:</a> <br> <br>
        <em> <span class="quran">
            - 'We never sent a messenger before you ˹O Prophet˺ without revealing to him: <strong> “There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Me, so worship Me ˹alone˺.”'</strong>
        </span>    </em> <br> <br>
        <!--------------SALAT EXPLANATION ------------------------------------------------------------->
         And then the "Salat" (Contact Prayer), being as the Guidance on this Straight Path. <br> 
         Let's see in short the definition of "Salat": The Prayer is not only the rise of hands and calling out for God.
         In Fact calling out for God, making a request, asking or desiring something from God is called a "Supplication" in arabic "Dua". <br>
         As "Salat" stands for a constructed form of Prayer, standing in front of Allah humbly, bowing and prostrating.
         <strong>Note:</strong> <em>Dua can be made in the Prayer, in prostration.</em> 
         <br><br> In Salat we also recite a specific Surah (chapter) of the Quran, which is "Al-Fatiha"(The Opener) the first Surah.
         <br> It's a must to recite it, in order for Salat being valid. We read in <a href="https://quran.com/1" target="_blank">Surah Al-Fatiha (1:1-7) </a> <br> <br>        
<em> <span class="quran"> 1:1 In the name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful. <br>
1:2 [All] praise is [due] to Allah, Lord of the worlds - <br>
1:3 The Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful, <br>
1:4 Sovereign of the Day of Recompense. <br>
1:5 <strong> It is You we worship and You we ask for help. </strong> -> (Unification, Oneness) <br>
1:6 <strong> Guide us to the straight path </strong> -> Asking for Guidance <br>
1:7 The path of those upon whom You have bestowed favor, not of those who have earned [Your] anger or of those who are astray. 
</span> </em> <br> <br> 

 <strong>The full <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tafsir" target="_blank"> Tafsir </a> (explanation) of this Chapter you can find <a href="https://quran.com/1:1/tafsirs/en-tafisr-ibn-kathir" target="_blank"> here </a></strong> <br> <br>
<!----------NOTE OF TAFSIR-------------------------------> 
<span class="quran" style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center; background-color: rgba(121, 201, 204, 0.651);"> <strong>Note</strong>: All of the Chapters and Verses of Quran are not Interpreted, Explained as we would like to. <br> 
    This is the 1st cause of MISCONCEPTIONS about Islam. <br>
In Quran we read about interpretation of verses: <a href="https://quran.com/3:7" target="_blank"> Chapter Ali Imran (Family of Imran), verse 7:</a> <br> <br>
<em> "It is He who has sent down to you, [O Muḥammad], the Book; in it are verses [that are] precise - they are the foundation of the Book - and others unspecific. 
As for those in whose hearts is deviation [from truth], they will follow that of it which is unspecific, seeking discord and seeking an interpretation [suitable to them]. 
And no one knows its [true] interpretation except Allah. But those firm in knowledge say, 'We believe in it. All [of it] is from our Lord.' "
And no one will be reminded except those of understanding. </em> 
-----------------------------> <a href="https://quran.com/3:7/tafsirs/en-tafisr-ibn-kathir" target="_blank">Tafsir (Explanation) of the verse</a>
</span>
<br> <br> 
<!------------CALL TO TAWHID and WORSHIP ALLAH------------------------------>
        So we come to know that from Adam to the last Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon them all) they called worshiping one and only God (towards Islam and Tawhid), submitting to one and only God (Allah).
         <br> And indeed they did Salat (The Contact Prayer), Fast, give Zakat (Charity) and the Kaaba was built by Abraham and his son Ismail. <br> <br>

         <!----------PRAYER, ZAKAT AND FASTING IN QURAN------------------>
         We read in Quran about Prayer and Zakat (Charity): <a href="https://quran.com/19/30-34" target="_blank"> Chapter Maryam (Mary) verses 30-34:</a> <br> <br>
         <em>            
<span class="quran"> 19:30 '[Jesus] said, "Indeed, I am the servant of Allah. He has given me the Scripture and made me a prophet." <br>
19:31 "And He has made me blessed wherever I am and has enjoined upon me <strong>Prayer and Zakāh </strong> as long as I remain alive"<br>
19:32 "And [made me] dutiful to my mother, and He has not made me a wretched tyrant."<br>
19:33 "And peace is on me the day I was born and the day I will die and the day I am raised alive." <br>
19:34 'That is Jesus, the son of Mary - the word of truth about which they are in dispute.' </span><br> <br> 
         </em> 
         Quran <a href="https://quran.com/14:40" target="_blank">Chapter Abraham, verse 40 (14:40):</a> <br> <br>
         <em> <span class="quran">             
         'Abraham said: "My Lord, make me an establisher of <strong> prayer, </strong> and [many] from my descendants. Our Lord, and accept my supplication"
        </span> </em> <br> <br>
<!---------BIBLE QUOTE-------------->
         Even in The Bible it's mentioned about Jesus: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+26&version=NIV" target="_blank">New Testament, Matthew 36-41: </a> <br> <br>
         <em> <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 190, 252, 0.616) ;" class="bible">
            36: Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, <strong> “Sit here while I go over there and pray.” </strong> <br>
            37: He (Jesus) took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled. <br>
            38: Then he (Jesus) said to them, “My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me.” <br>
            39: (and he Jesus) Going a little farther, <strong> he fell with his face to the ground and prayed,</strong> “My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will.” <br>
            40: Then he (Jesus) returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. “Couldn’t you men keep watch with me for one hour?” he asked Peter. <br>
            41: “Watch and <strong> pray </strong> so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”" 
        </span> <br>
         </em>
         <br><br>
         Quran <a href="https://quran.com/22:78" target="_blank">Chapter Hajj (Pilgrimage), verse 78:</a> <br> <br>
         <em> <span class="quran">
         22:78   "And strive for Allah with the striving due to Him. He has chosen you and has not placed upon you in the religion any difficulty. 
            [It is] the religion of your father, Abraham. He [i.e., Allah] named you "Muslims" before [in former scriptures] and in this [revelation] that the Messenger may be a witness over you and you may be witnesses over the people. 
            So establish <strong> prayer and give zakāh and hold fast to Allah. </strong> He is your protector; and excellent is the protector, and excellent is the helper."
        </span>

        <!-------HAJJ KAABA IN ISLAM---------------->

        Construction Of Kaaba by Abraham and his son: Quran <a href="https://quran.com/2:127" target="_blank">Chapter Baqarah (Cow), verse 127:</a> <br> <br>
        <span class="quran"><em>
         2:127 - "And [mention] when Abraham was raising the <strong>foundations of the House and [with him] Ishmael</strong>, [saying], "Our Lord, accept [this] from us. Indeed, You are the Hearing, the Knowing."
        </em></span class="quran"> <br> <br>

        Visiting Kaaba: Quran <a href="https://quran.com/22:26" target="_blank">Chapter Hajj (Pilgrimage), verse 26-27:</a> <br> <br>

                The well-known difference between a Prophet* and a Messenger**  </a> 
                is that a Messenger is one to whom a law is revealed and he is commanded to convey it,
                 whilst a Prophet is one to whom a law is revealed but he is not commanded to convey it...
              <br> Hence Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: "The correct view is that the Messenger is 
              one who is sent to a disbelieving people, and the Prophet is one who is sent to a believing people 
              with the sharee’ah of the Messenger who came before him, to teach them and judge between them",
                 as Allaah says  (in Quran): <br>
                “Verily, We did send down the Tawraat (Torah) [to Moosa (Moses)], therein was guidance and light, by which the Prophets, who submitted themselves to Allaah’s Will, judged for the Jews...”                
               <br> <a style="float: right; color: aliceblue;" href="https://quran.com/5:44" target="_blank">[al-Maa’idah 5:44] </a> <br>         
                So the Prophets of the Children of Israel judged by the Tawraat which Allaah had revealed to Moosa. <br>
                “....but he (Muhammad) is the Messenger of Allaah and the last (end) of the Prophets” <br>
                <a style="float: right; color: aliceblue;" href="https://quran.com/33:40" target="_blank">[al-Ahzaab 33:40] </a>

        were sent before him to all the Nations and called to the same Message.
        The Messsage was "Tawhid" (Unification, Oneness of Allah),

        <br><br> <a href="https://quran.com/21:25" target="_blank">Chapter Al Anbiya (The Prophets) verse 25:</a> <br> <br>
          <em> <span class="quran">
              - 'We never sent a messenger before you ˹O Prophet˺ without revealing to him: <strong>“There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Me, so worship Me ˹alone˺.”'</strong>
          </span> </em>
        
        <br><br>And to complete, Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) is the last of the Prophets sent to humanity confirming the Message which was revealed before him.

        <em><span class="quran">

<!---------------HADITH PROPHETS ARE BROTHERS---------------------------->
    <br> <br> Also in Hadeeth (Narrations) of the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) : <br> <br>
    <span class="hadith"> Narrated by Abu Huraira (Companion of the Prophet): Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: "Both in this world and in the Hereafter, I am the nearest of all the people to Jesus, the son of Mary. 
           The prophets are paternal brothers(The Tawhid); their mothers are different (Laws, Scriptures), but their religion is one.(Islam)" 
       </span> <br>
        <br><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3443" target="_blank" style="float: right; padding-right: 20px;">Ref: Sahih al-Bukhari 3443</a> <br> <br>
        From this Hadeeth (Narration) we learn that indeed all of the Prophets were upon the same Message! Their scriptures and laws were different. <br>
        But they were Muslims(Submitters) accepted Islam (Complete Submission to the will of one and only God).

       <!-----------------------------------SUMMARY ------------------------------> 
        <p style="font-weight: bolder; font-family: cursive; font-size: 16px;"> 
            Congratulations again, we are done with the second point. Discover the truth about Muslims so we may not be fooled by 
            information given by "FakeNews" talking about Islam and Muslims. <br>
        <br> Let's sum up: So the person accepting Islam (Submission to the will of one God) is called Muslim (Submitter).  <br>
        Islam is "Tawhid" (Unification, Oneness of God in worship). All the Prophets and Messengers were Muslims (submitted) preaching "Tawhid". <br>
        The last Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) is the "Seal of the Prophets". <br>
        Following the last of the Scriptures and the Last Prophet is mandatory for submitting to the will of God. <br>
        As it was at the time of all the Prophets. (While they were alive and after they passed away). <br>
        Until new Prophet was sent down confirming "Tawhid" and new scripture was revealed to him.<br> <br>
        As you may have noticed, i have quoted Quran a lot. <br>
        Let's move on and <a href="./aboutquran.html">Discover the Last Scripture</a> revealed to our Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him).
